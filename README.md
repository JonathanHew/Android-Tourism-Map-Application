# Android Irish Tourism Guide App 

Name: Jonathan Hew 

# Description of the assignment
For this project I designed and developed an Android App. The app was created for Irish tourists. When they use this app they will be able to find the locations of popular attractions and some information about them also. I coded this application in Java using Android Studio.

The application functionality contains: 
  - Data stored in a local SQLLite database
  - an input screen where the user enters data
  - a list populated by the SQL database
  - CRUD operations on the database, i.e INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE.
  - Google maps feature 
  - Location services feature (User location tracking and updating)
